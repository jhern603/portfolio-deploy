# Jose Hernandez's Redesigned Portfolio
## A new design using new technologies

I am Jose Hernandez, and my current portfolio is a mess that was thrown together within the span of 1 working day. It works, but doesn't look good, nor does it work good either.

Additionally, my original portfolio was built on pure HTML/CSS/JS.

I have decided to redesign my portfolio to start creating a personal brand, as well as to practice working with new technologies such as React and SASS. 

This repo is a demonstration of my skills thus far as a front-end developer, as well as my portfolio as it stands..
